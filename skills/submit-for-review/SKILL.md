# Submit for Review

## Prerequisites

Before running this skill, ensure:

- PR is created and CI is green
- App-specific proof of work is done (see `<nx-project-path>/WORKFLOW.md`)
- PR feedback sweep is clean (no outstanding actionable comments)

## Step 1 — Update workpad with evidence

Update the workpad comment on Linear (see `$SKILLS_ROOT/linear/SKILL.md` for the update command).

The environment stamp at the top of the workpad (`<host>:<abs-workdir>@<short-sha>`) is an agent-readable signature — do not remove it.

Ensure all checklist items are checked off and the `### Validation` section shows passing results.

## Step 2 — Move to Human Review

Read `$SKILLS_ROOT/linear/SKILL.md` for the state transition curl command. Use the **Human Review** state ID:

```bash
STATE_ID="$STATE_HUMAN_REVIEW"
```
